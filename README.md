# word war
Challenge your friends in a real-time, multiplayer word game where words are your weapon. Create words from the given letters on a screen and catapult them to one of your challengers. Try to win the top spot by stealing points from your competitors, and preventing them from stealing your own points. At the end of each round, only one warrior can become Word Royalty.

# how to run
We used Parse, Firebase, and pop to create Word War, so once you've downloaded the project, please do a pod install to get the required frameworks. :) And then you should be able to load it on your phone / simulator and play!

# about us
We're Flying Sloths! We (Chris, Justice, Zareen) created this game while we were at Facebook University under the mentorship of Jason. This was our first times doing mobile development, and it was an awesome experience!
