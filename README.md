# word war
Challenge your friends in a real-time, multiplayer word game where words are your weapon. Create words from the given letters on a screen and catapult them to one of your challengers. Try to win the top spot by stealing points from your competitors, and preventing them from stealing your own points. At the end of each round, only one warrior can become Word Royalty.

# how to play
Getting into the game:
- Login via Facebook
- Tap a sword to join game, or tap the "Start New War" board to create a new one
- Once everyone you want to play with is in your war, only ONE person needs to press "Start War"

In the game:
- Tap letters to add them to your current word
- Words must be >3 letters, real, and never used before
- Pale red - invalid word, shiny green - valid word
- With a valid word, you can swipe up to fling a word bomb at a player, or pull down to catapult it
- The angle at which you throw the bomb chooses the player
- Each opponent has a score (bottom left number) and a rank (bottom right number)
- Your goal is to get the LEAST number of points at the end (sending a bomb sends YOUR points to THEIR score)

# how to run
We used Parse, Firebase, and pop to create Word War, so once you've downloaded the project, please do a pod install to get the required frameworks. :) And then you should be able to load it on your phone / simulator and play!

# known bugs/problems
Sometimes Word War crashes when the game ends. \o/ But Zareen and Chris don't have Macs, so somehow we'll fix it.

Currently this game is not scaled at all. It only works well on iPhone 6 currently.

# about us
We're Flying Sloths! We (Chris, Justice, Zareen) created this game while we were at Facebook University under the mentorship of Jason. This was our first times doing mobile development, and it was an awesome experience!
